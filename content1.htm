<font color=black  size=+2 face=times><p align=justify>It is quite difficult to get a job, this is not due to high requirements, but due to the fact that vacancies appear extremely rarely. When they appear, a diploma is usually not enough. Experience and the availability of research practice play a key role.</p>
<p align=justify>A biologist is first of all a great lover of nature and all living things. This profession requires perseverance, accuracy and attentiveness â€“ these qualities will help in conducting research and observations. An analytical mindset will make research activities as effective as possible. A biologist must have a well-developed long-term memory, as some information can often come in handy.
