<font color=black  size=+2 face=times><p align=justify>My hobby is chess. I learned to play a long time ago, at about 6 years old. One day, Uncle Pasha, a colleague from Dad's work, came to us. He saw that I was playing chess pieces, just using them as soldiers. He decided to teach me this beautiful game, and he did it pretty quickly. In addition, the next day he gave me a children's book on learning to play chess, and also installed a training program on my computer. I am very grateful to him, because that day, he gave me a wonderful hobby.</p>
<p align=justify>Most of all I like to play with real people, not with a computer, it's much more interesting this way. Of my friends and acquaintances, only a few people know how to play chess, and it doesn't matter. Even Uncle Pasha, who introduced me to chess, I beat quite easily, which, by the way, he is very proud of. Therefore, I prefer to play online on the Internet, since players can be found there at any time and in large numbers. Moreover, you can choose any level there, personally I prefer players a little stronger than me.</p>
