<img src="ppppp.jpg" width=300 height=400 Hspace=40 Vspace=5 class="leftimg" align=left><font color=black  size=+2 face=times><p align=justify>My name is Daulybayeva Bakhytzhan. I am from the village of Shukirlik of the Ayyrtau district of the North Kazakhstan region. I was born in 2002. There are five people in my family: dad, mom, brothers and me. I am currently a 2nd year student at M. Kozybayev University, I like to spend a lot of time with my family and friends.</p>
<p align=justify>I am a sociable person. I think I took after my father. In fact, my parents are friendly and hospitable. They like to invite our friends and neighbors. Sometimes I like to stay at home alone, especially when I need to relax a little. Then I listen to music, watch TV or read books. I love reading. I prefer historical novels. Some detective stories are also very interesting. It is generally believed that detectives cannot be regarded as real literature. I don't agree with that. It all depends on the skill and gift of the writer.</p>
<p align=justify>I don't exercise regularly. But if I have the opportunity, I go to the pool. I also like to play various ball games such as volleyball, basketball.</p>
